# Issues Encountered will be in this Doc

## Early stages (render pipeline and before)

1. creation of the ECS model mimicing, by using arrays of functions
    - Every game object contains an array of scripts,
    - the scripts range from simple movers to models
    - Every game object will be comprised of multiple scripts
    - scripts all inherit from a base scriptable object class

2. Update function has been abstracted into a different class that contains an array of the different functions.
    - Update has an array of update functions, calls all update functions
    - (easier to implement early / late update later, easier to add functions to update)

3. Render pipeline crash due to reinstatiation of VAO, VBO, Fragment Shader & Vertex Shader
    - moved all render pipeline to own classes

4. Overhauled all rendering pipeline objects to class model, also now using scripts in objects
    - all pieces in the render pipeline (so far) are self contained in scripts

5. Fragment Shader and vertex Shader storage system, specific formatting for easy understanding
    - simple function call to get shader, storage of shader is preffered, as it makes rendering faster
    - shader formatting :
    - ![Breakdown of how the shaders are formatted](.\MarkdownImgs\ShaderFormat.png "ShaderFormatImage")

6. GameObject pool is self contained and calls all functions necessary
    - Game Object pool contains all world game objects (can be used to reinstantiate a scene quickly)

7. added the mathmatical functionality to move objects across the screen efficiently
    - changed movement to be based on the forward quternion vector

8. changed the vertex shader to account for movement
    - changed the vertex shader to account for camera movement in 3d space

9. Created an encapsulated input system that holds the key down events for keys
    - Vector of key presses, asign true if the button is pressed down

10. created a mouse input system to track mouse delta
    - save the x and y of the mouse position

11. issue with reading the escape to exit the mouse from the screen (fixed)
    - reading of the button inputs for non standard A-Z numerals was incorrect

12. allowing clicking back into the window
    - saved mouse down events

13. camera movement
    - made it so that you can use WASD to move (Q and E are used for up down movement)
    - ![Breakdown of how the camera position works](.\MarkdownImgs\CameraPassing.png "CameraPassingLayout")

## Ground Creation

1. grouund tile ebo usage, keeps breaking, reverted back to no ebo
    - now using, kind of, still using vertex connections, but not specifically using the vertices,
    - This is because the vertex shader UV coordinates

2. worked on random displacement for floor mesh
    - Changed Y value of floors
    - Will change to use nois later


3. linking of vertices in the floor mesh
    - quite tedious as need a way to recall previous coordinates, and iterate through them easily
    - changed to use x y deformation that is pre calculated
    - ![General floor mesh linking plan](.\MarkdownImgs\MeshLinking.png "mesh linking plan")

4. Render order issues
    - hard to understand what the render order wrapping was, had to redo the order and the UV coordinated Multiple times for the floor

5. ReInstantiation issue
    - ONE AMPERSAND HAS COST ME 3 DAYS

## Research:
    - Rock climbing game, with surface (snowboarding?)

## -
- document noise / cube sphere - links, reasoning


## Links
- cube sphere implementation documentation
- https://songho.ca/opengl/gl_sphere.html
- Cube sphere has been used to make the process of joining faces easier, and so that uv coordinates are even across faces, as oposed to the ico sphere where faces are not even
    Also gives a higher level of control of the vertices of the asset

- Noise Map generation
- https://github.com/SaintGimp/LibNoise
- this noise has been converted from c# to c++
    used to keep terrain changes consistent

## Implementation of LOD
### Phase 1: Restructure Face Management

- Create `CubeSphereFaceLOD` class extending `CubeSphereFace`
- Add per-face LOD level tracking
- Implement distance calculation from camera to face center

### Phase 2: Implement Face Culling

- Add camera position access to `CubeSphere`
- Implement back-face culling using dot product test
- Add frustum culling using camera view frustum

### Phase 3: Dynamic LOD System

- Replace single `pointsPerRow` with per-face resolution
- Implement LOD level calculation based on distance/screen size
- Add smooth transitions between LOD levels

### Phase 4: Optimization Enhancements

- Implement mesh caching system
- Add asynchronous mesh generation for smooth performance
- Optimize vertex buffer updates for changed faces only

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

- Implement seamless LOD transitions using geometry tessellation
- Add adaptive subdivision based on terrain complexity
- Implement horizon culling for planetary scale
